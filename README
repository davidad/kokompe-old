GEOMEVAL 0.2, By Ara Knaian
Part of OPENCAD

There are (4) ways to build GEOMEVAL

A. As a Python module
 
  1. Make sure python and numarray are installed
     apt-get install python-numarray

  2. Run "sudo python setup.py install" to build 
     and install the python interface

  3. You should now be able to "import geomeval"
     in python.  See "pyint.cpp" for documentation. :)

B. As a command-line demo program for Linux

  1. Type "make" 

  2. Run geomeval  (Note: currently, the function to be 
     evaluated is just a string in geomeval.cpp)  This
     should change soon.

C. As a command-line demo program for Windows

  1. Install MSVC++ Express Edition 2005, which is
     freeware downloadable from Microsoft.

  2. Install MSVC++ Service Pack 1.  This is IMPORTANT.

  3. Double click on geomeval.vbproj.

  4. Click the "Build geomeval" menu option.

  5. You can run the same app is in Linux, but with 
     a WIN32 OPENGL window to display the object.


D. As an XML-RPC server for Linux

  1. apt-get install libcurl3-dev

  2. Install XMLRPC-C from http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net.  Download tarball,
     ./configure --enable-curl-client --prefix /usr
     make
     make install

  3. make xmlrpc_server
  Note: I did a lot of hacks to get this to build (mainly using their
  config.h generated by configure.  I think to make this clean I would
  need to to a proper autoconf + automake build process for opencad
