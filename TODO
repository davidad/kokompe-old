FEATURE REQUESTS
----------------


SHORT-TERM MUST DO
==================

1. All-the-way-through working UI to go from Python .CAD to 
rendered 3D images.  (web PHP?)

2. All-the-way-through UI to do the same for 2D geometry. (web PHP?)

3. Toolpath generation for 2-D tools.
  (apparently the grassfire toolpath algorithim has a fatal flaw?)  

4. Output to laser cutter, waterjet, etc. ported from cad.py

5. Clear documentation of all build dependencies --- procedure
to build from scratch.

6. Get web interface (amy PHP) into version control.

LONGER-TERM 
===========

1. Color rendering of objects with multivalued math string?

2. Differentiate math string to explicitly get surface normals,
   explicitly reconginize surfaces, etc.  This could be for
   increased evaluation speed, smaller/more accurate 3D models,
   ability to click edges, etc.

3. Hybrid program combining clicking to more anchor points with writing 
   code to describe objects that allows high-speed circuit board routing
   and artistic playing but also allows arbitrary shape generation through
   code and easy automation of tasks through code, and documents the
   whole object in human-readable text.  (Forrest has a good plan.)

4. Add a parametric variable, t, ranging from [0,1], and a syntax where
   the object gets rendered everywhere the expression is true for any 
   value of t.  This would allow spirals, extrusion of 2-D geometries
   along 3-D linear paths, etc. which are not currently possible with 
   the implicit function format.

BUGS
----

1. trimesh: Corner finder doesn't always work, resulting in little 
inclusions along corners.  Is it getting the inside/outside
direction wrong?  Try coloring corners to see...


2. trimesh: Rendering on a non-cubic region causes a bizzare directional 
incorrect-noral artifact.  This is clearly visbile rendering
the unit sphere on -.5 .5 -1 1 -1 1.  A short term workaround
is to always use cubic regions: this isn't much of a performance hit,
due to the octree.  Longer term, we should find out why---this may
point the way to other bugs.
