FEATURE REQUESTS
----------------


SHORT-TERM MUST DO
==================

1. All-the-way-through working UI to go from Python .CAD to 
rendered 3D images.  (web PHP?)

2. All-the-way-through UI to do the same for 2D geometry. (web PHP?)

3. Toolpath generation for 2-D tools.
  (apparently the grassfire toolpath algorithim has a fatal flaw?)  

4. Output to laser cutter, waterjet, etc. ported from cad.py

5. Clear documentation of all build dependencies --- procedure
to build from scratch.

6. Get web interface (amy PHP) into version control.

LONGER-TERM 
===========

1. Color rendering of objects with multivalued math string?

2. Differentiate math string to explicitly get surface normals,
   explicitly reconginize surfaces, etc.  This could be for
   increased evaluation speed, smaller/more accurate 3D models,
   ability to click edges, etc.

3. Hybrid program combining clicking to more anchor points with writing 
   code to describe objects that allows high-speed circuit board routing
   and artistic playing but also allows arbitrary shape generation through
   code and easy automation of tasks through code, and documents the
   whole object in human-readable text.  (Forrest has a good plan.)

4. Add a parametric variable, t, ranging from [0,1], and a syntax where
   the object gets rendered everywhere the expression is true for any 
   value of t.  This would allow spirals, extrusion of 2-D geometries
   along 3-D linear paths, etc. which are not currently possible with 
   the implicit function format.

5. Improved expression support: Support for powers other than 2, 
   exp, and ln functions.  (and automatic differention of these
   functions.)  Because ln and power are undefined on some ranges,
   this might be slightly tricky, but we can probably do something
   sensible.  (right now we deal with the same problem that / is
   undefined if the denominator is 0 with no problems --- one approach
   would be to explicitly introduce branch cuts into expressions
   where the function might be undefined by modifying the math string
   with booleans; e.g. ln(x^2) > 4  -->  (x^2 > 0) & ( ln(x^2) > 4 )

BUGS
----

1. trimesh: Corner finder doesn't always work, resulting in little 
inclusions along corners.  Is it getting the inside/outside
direction wrong?  Try coloring corners to see...


2. trimesh: Rendering on a non-cubic region causes a bizzare directional 
incorrect-noral artifact.  This is clearly visbile rendering
the unit sphere on -.5 .5 -1 1 -1 1.  A short term workaround
is to always use cubic regions: this isn't much of a performance hit,
due to the octree.  Longer term, we should find out why---this may
point the way to other bugs.
